# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Rules

1. When answering questions, provide multiple solutions if possible.
2. When explaining solutions, use words not code. Only write code when implementing.
3. Debate with the user when you disagree. The user is not always right.
4. Comment code clearly — explain the why, not the what.
5. Write clean, readable code. Prioritize clarity over cleverness.
6. Use English to respond.
7. Don't use emojis.

## How to slove problems
1. Understand the problem: Read the user's question carefully. Ask clarifying questions if needed.
2. Read the relevant code: Identify which files and functions are related to the user's question. Skim through them to get a sense of their purpose.
3. Research: If the question involves unfamiliar concepts, look them up. Use official documentation and reputable sources.
4. Give multiple solutions: Whenever possible, provide more than one way to solve the problem. Explain the pros and cons of each approach.
5. Wait for user feedback: After providing an answer, ask if the user needs further clarification or assistance.
